		<strong>PESeBay</strong> is a virtual bookstore to facilitate exchange of books among PESIT students. 

		<em>Why PESebay ?</em>
		<br /><br />
		
			<ul>
				<li> We believe that an online platform would make books more visible and would simplify the whole process. </li>

				<li> You don't have to agree to the terms of purchase set by various 'campus stores'. You decide your own price. </li>

				<li> Xerox notes, lab manuals etc are reusable and can be passed on to juniors effectively. </li>

				<li> We loose valuable assets by giving books to different campus stores. We loose books filled with important points
				     [ by PESIT  seniors ?! :-)]. Books stay within our own network. </li>

		    </ul>

		
		<br />
		

		    <ul><h4>Selling Books :</h4>

		      	<li> You click on 'Sell Books' button on the home page. </li>

		      	<li> You fill in your details and the book details. You are required to fill in the discount that you would want to offer on the marked price to estimate the resale value of the book. </li>

		      	<li> We send you an email containing a transaction key. Also sent in the email are the details as to when we would meet you to collect the books. You can let us know if you would want a change in the timings or the venue. </li>

		      	<li> When we meet, you mention the transaction key and we validate it. We collect the books. Only after we collect the books, the books appear in the search listing. </li>

 				<li> You can set a sale period, and if the book is not sold within that period, we would return the book to you. Once the books are sold, we email you the details for collecting your money.</li>

 				<li> Once you get your money, may be you would like to treat us :-) </li>

 			</ul> 	 

 			<br />
      		<ul><h4>Buying Books :</h4>
      				<li> You specify the title of the book in the search bar on the home page. </li>

      				<li> You can select any of the books from the search listing and add it to your cart. </li>

      				<li> You can keep searching for additional books and keep them adding to your cart. </li>

      				<li> You can take a look at your cart by clicking on the 'My Cart' button. You can delete books if you want to. 
      				</li>

      			    <li> Once you click on 'close shopping and buy these books' button, a confirmation link would be sent to your emailid. </li>

      			    <li> Only after you click the confirmation link, your order is acknowledged and those books are kept reserved for you. </li>

      			    <li> We would also email you the details as to when you would receive the books and the total amount. </li>

      			    <li> We would like to see you smile, once you receive your books :-) </li>

      	    </ul>

      	 We would  love to hear back from you.
